This is my neovim configuration folder, you should give it a try!
# Installation
---
- Change the directory into `~/.config`(if you're on a linux-based OS)
- Clone this repo by: `git clone https://github.com/jspmic/nvim.git`
- Run neovim by typing `nvim` in the terminal, and let packer do the rest.
  If `packer` doesn't run automatically, run `PackerSync` after running neovim

# Appreciation
---
I also want to thank the neovim community for creating such useful and great plugins, keep up the good work guys!
